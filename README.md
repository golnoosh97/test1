### How to set up

* Install `python`.
* Have `pip`

And:

```
pip install mkdocs
```
```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Then:

```
# Go to repo folder where `mkdocs.yaml` is. (Use cd command)
mkdocs serve
```

It will make a local server. Go to `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` on your browser. You should see the doc.
